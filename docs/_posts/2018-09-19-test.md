# Introduction 
This is a guide for creating new pages using Github Pages (and the underlying Jekyll).

# Writing the page
1. Write the page in markdown, and with the appropriate heading for Jekyll (the easiest way to do this is to copy the default page heading).
1. Place the markdown file in the `/pages/` folder.

# Linking to the page
1. Add a link to that page where you want it, using the `\[Link text\]\(/pages/your-page.html\)` command on the page you want.
